# Tasks API built on top of Rust/Actix

[![Deploy Actions](https://github.com/Macquarie-University-DSC/tasks_api_rs_actions/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Macquarie-University-DSC/tasks_api_rs_actions/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This is a remake of tasks api but in a single binary for easier deployment. Also conforms better to the tasks spec
regarding errors.
